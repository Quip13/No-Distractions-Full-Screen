The most comprehensive full screen addon! Eliminates <i>everything</i> unnecessary during reviews giving you maximum usable screen space and a clean interface.

<b><code>Features:</code></b>
- Press <b>F11</b> to enable or use menu option (View -&gt; Full Screen) <i>(hotkey can be changed in config)</i>
- <b>Hides all menu bars</b> including bottom bar ("More, Edit") and both top bars ("File, Edit..." and "Decks, Add...")
- <b>Superimposes answer buttons</b> over cards, with <b>adjustable opacity</b>. Becomes opaque on mouse-over <i>(color can be adjusted in config)</i>
- Option to <b>hide mouse cursor if idle</b> <i>(idle time can be adjusted in config)</i>
- <b>No Distractions Windowed mode</b>: Same clean interface in a re-sizable window. Accessible through menu. Can set to <b>always be on top</b>
- All cards types are compatible; cards are dynamically padded so that superimposed answer buttons do not obscure the bottom of cards when scrolled down (compatible with zoom addons)

<b><code>Note:</code></b>
- The F11 shortcut will automatically toggle the last enabled mode (either fullscreen or windowed)
- All base shortcut functionality is preserved. (Is a bug with other full screen implementations)
- Please use the config to fine tune settings. Can be accessed through: <i>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-ons-&gt;No Distractions Full Screen-&gt;Config</i>. Detailed descriptions are within config.
